I would like to have more self-discipline when it comes to my lifestyle. I don’t feel confident or know how and where to start building a routine,filler,"Hello!

Acknowledging a need or a lack of something in one’s life is a brave and necessary first step to getting better, and I’m glad you’ve already taken it! Wanting to have more self-discipline is a pretty healthy desire! But, it’s not a cakewalk getting our life in order.

And that’s the first thing I’d like you to know - getting self-discipline with your lifestyle is not a linear journey. There are days when it seems easy to make healthier choices and days when you may just want to curl up in bed and eat ice cream straight out of the tub. Going through these waves in your health journey is common and expected.

You seem to have identified a lack of self-confidence - you don’t feel confident in building a routine for yourself, and so you sabotage all your efforts. I wonder what else there is to this pattern. Where does the lack of self-confidence come from? 

Let me give you some food for thought before you answer…

Many people start their ~~health~~ journey with a specific goal - maybe they want to lose some weight; maybe they want to get on a diet or be able to run a certain length or work and sleep at a particular time. While these specific and concrete goals help us get started, we may need more motivation once we meet them. For example, if your goal is to lose 10 pounds and you manage to do that in a month, you may no longer feel motivated to go further.

Another common reason to lose motivation is setting unsustainable routines. For example, sustaining it may be extremely difficult if you’ve gone from having dessert daily to completely cutting off sugar.

Yet another reason for giving up is when we don’t see obvious results quickly. We may feel that we’re not doing it right or will never meet our goals and give up.

Can you relate to any of this? If not, that’s alright.",guided_journaling,What do you think are your current goals when it comes to self-discipline? Let’s write it down.,guided_journaling,"What are the messages, values, and beliefs you have learned about self-care?

"I have a hard time finding the motivation or reason to do the things I want to do so badly. I am always coming up with excuses, I am always procrastinating. I am unable to achieve the things I want most out of my life",filler,"Hi there!

One of the hardest things to do is to set realistic and achievable expectations. But it’s so so important to figure out how to do this. Because when we set unrealistically high expectations for ourselves, we inadvertently set ourselves up for failure.

Of course, there’s always scope for improvement. Even the best can get better because better, by definition, is relative. It’s not a static destination you can reach and check off your list.

But at what point does it become enough?

We often underestimate the value of ‘enough.’ Enough is that sweet spot where we’re fulfilling our potential, have a balance between input and output, and can enjoy different aspects of life - work, recreation, relationships, and good health.",guided_journaling,What does your ‘enough’ look like?,guided_journaling,Where do you think your lack of motivation is coming from?,guided_journaling,What does emotional regulation look like for you?,practice_breathing,breathing_4_x_4,,,,
I tend to feel shame and guilt when I procrastinate getting things done. I just feel annoyed and anxious about myself,filler,"Pushing work for later can feel unsettling at times, right? Although we procrastinate for various reasons, it often always leaves us feeling annoyed or guilty. In this mini-therapy, we will reflect on those reasons and how to regulate emotions to overcome them. Let’s go!

Let's start by meditating on the reasons behind your procrastination.",practice_awareness,What thoughts or emotions arise when you think about the tasks you need to complete? Take a deep breath and let these thoughts and emotions come to you. Remember to be kind to yourself and acknowledge these feelings. I’ll give you some time.,reflective_questions,Reflect on your previous experiences with procrastination and consider what might be causing it. What are some underlying emotions or fears? Would you like to sit with this thought?

I want to know how to navigate differences in my relationship but not be so easily affected by the conflicts - it impacts my mood devastatingly and I don't know how to recover from the arguments,filler,"I am so happy to see you here! I see that you are having difficulty navigating differences in your relationship. Don’t worry, you’re not alone! Relationships are tricky even under the best of circumstances. Add a little conflict to the mix and they can feel really unsettling.

Conflict is hard when you are with someone you care about. Oftentimes, emotions are put on overdrive and our ability to have any kind of meaningful conversation goes out the window. Or, we are so afraid of hurting others’ feelings that we back down entirely and start blaming ourselves.

As you move about this therapy, you will gain a greater understanding of why it is difficult for you to navigate differences, why conflict feels so devastating to you, and how to regulate your emotions so that you don’t feel so emotionally activated for so long after the conflict.

Sounds good? Great! Let’s get started!

The best way to understand the present is to look at the past. This will help you understand why you are having difficulty. Remember, every behavior stems from somewhere. Knowing where your behavior originated will help you make sense of what is going on now.

What follows are some questions to get you started. This will help you reflect on how the conflict was handled and resolved in your family. For example, were you told that your opinion doesn’t matter, that you didn’t know anything, etc? Did conflict resolve peacefully or did it cause rifts in relationships? Whatever it is for you, I want you to write it down.",guided_journaling,"1.

"I procrastinate. I may have the time to start or finish something, but I choose not to do it, then I get mad at myself",filler,"If you find yourself putting off tasks until the last minute, or even avoiding them altogether, it could be really frustrating. I understand. Procrastination is a habit that can make us disappointed, stressed, and anxious. Everyone procrastinates at some point. In this mini-therapy, we will explore the reasons for procrastination and provide some tips to help you deal with it effectively. Let’s go.

At this point, it's important to understand why you procrastinate. Consider this - If you feel overwhelmed or distracted by tasks at hand, afraid of making mistakes, or even realize that you have high expectations of yourself, you may find it difficult to complete tasks. Why? There could be many reasons why you procrastinate, including fear, lack of motivation, and distractions, among others.

"I feel like I'm worthless. Worthless because I don't feel like I do things right. I fear that I'll make mistakes when doing tasks, which only confirms my feelings of worthlessness",filler,"Hi, I'm glad you’re here! What you are struggling with resonates with so many people. That feeling of worthlessness has such a stronghold, doesn’t it? And then fear of failure creeps in and before you know it, it feels like you are diving head first into a shallow pond.

Okay, so that is a weird visual, but not entirely off the mark right?

The point is, you must be feeling pretty overwhelmed with this cycle of feeling worthless, and fear of failure, leading to more feelings of worthlessness.

I am here to help you understand a little more about where this feeling of worthlessness comes from, and how to face it and move toward the things that matter to you.

I know you feel apprehensive right now. Do you know how I know that? Because you fear failure, which means trying new things is super scary. But the fact that you are facing that fear right now just by being here says a lot about your desire to change that.

The first thing I want you to do is to challenge yourself to release any story you might be telling yourself that this won’t work. This will be challenging, or you might fail. I’m going to give you a mantra to repeat to yourself throughout this therapy and really, throughout your life when you start questioning yourself.",practice_affirmations,"Even though I fear failing, I fully accept myself for who I am.

"Sometimes, I feel really bad, like something is off. It makes me nauseous and vomit, and I cry too",filler,"What we feel emotionally is also felt physically. But sometimes, the physical experience can be intense and scary. Nausea, vomiting, and even uncontrollable crying are all distress signs - a plea for comfort. But, they can make us feel even more anxious, especially when they are intense, and seem uncontrollable. This is a vicious cycle.

We have anxious thoughts and feelings; we start feeling weird in the body; this makes us worry even more and our anxious thoughts and feelings become more intense; we try to stop it all but when that doesn’t work, we feel even more terrible, if that’s possible.

That’s a lot.

Let’s take a moment to center ourselves before we move forward. Our breath is a vital tool we can use to regulate ourselves. For most people, deep breathing while anxious helps them release some intensity. For some, however, it may make it momentarily more intense. However, inculcating a daily breathwork practice helps.

Today, I will take you through something called ‘box breathing’. This technique commonly benefits individuals who experience physical anxiety symptoms by slowing down their breathing and distracting them with counting.

As you breathe in, hold, and out, silently count to five.

Let’s begin…",practice_breathing,breathing_5_x_5_x_5_x_5,guided_journaling,In what situations does this discomfort occur? Think of the last few incidents and look for a pattern.,,,,,,,,
"I didn’t feel passionate about my job. It gave me good money, but I didn't have the courage or resources to try something else. I thought that people will judge me if I quit my job because I wasn't good at it or wasn't making enough money. At least once a year, I feel exhausted and lose interest in work",filler,"We all have certain expectations when it comes to a job. We all have an intent behind our job choices. It could be a passion, a purpose, an identity for ourselves, and most of all a meaning to the life we would live. As soon as the job we seek fails to meet those expectations, we feel stuck. We do the same work, but it doesn’t make us feel empowered but rather drained and exhausted. We lose our interest as it is probably no longer serving the purpose that you expected it to.

Before we move any further, how about we address the exhaustion you feel now?

Close your eyes and observe your breathing.

Do not try to rhythm your breathing or exercise them. Let it be. Notice the air you breathe in, the path it takes, and the way you release your breath.
